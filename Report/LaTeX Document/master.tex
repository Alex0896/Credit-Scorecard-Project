\begin{abstract}
The acceptance or rejection of a creditee is a difficult task for the lender. On one hand, every applicant is potential profit but on the other, they all come with varying risks of defaulting and potential loss. The lenders have many tools for maximinzing their profit whilst maintaining a low risk. One such method is credit scorecards and scorecard modelling. By using previous applicants data we can develop a score of potential new applicants and their risk of being unable to repay their loan. In this project I will first introduce some of the methods used in scorecard modelling and then apply these to a real world data set, producing several scorecards and comparing their performance. We found that a logistic regression was capable of developing a suitable model for this data set. Finally I will demonstate the scorecards ability to be applied to other fields of study by reapplying the methods done on the credit score data onto a data set of patients with covid-19 and producing a health risk scorecard on the outcome of a patient.
